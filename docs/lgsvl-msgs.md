  - BoundingBox3D.msg       # A 3D bounding box definition
  - Detection2DArray.msg    # A list of 2D detections
  - Detection2D.msg         # 2D detection including id, label, score, and 2D bounding box
  - BoundingBox2D.msg       # A 2D bounding box definition
  - SignalArray.msg         # A list of traffic light detections
  - Signal.msg              # 3D detection of a traffic light including id, label, score, and 3D bounding box
  - CanBusData.msg          # Can bus data for an ego vehicle published by the simulator
  - VehicleControlData.msg  # Defines vehicle control data the simulator subscribes to
  - VehicleStateData.msg    # Data published by the simulator describing the full state of an ego vehicle
```

# Installation
`lgsvl_msgs` is built by the ROS build farm. Binaries can be installed on Ubuntu as follows:
